REQP-1840#13 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 U_curve_mul_256/bram_rz1/bram_reg has an input control pin U_curve_mul_256/bram_rz1/bram_reg/ADDRARDADDR[7] (net: U_curve_mul_256/bram_rz1/ADDRARDADDR[2]) which is driven by a register (U_curve_mul_256/FSM_onehot_fsm_state_reg[13]_rep) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
